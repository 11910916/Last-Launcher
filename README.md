### Short story:
I have been questing for a simple and minimal launcher that is light weight on RAM and easy on Device battery. I became fed up by the Android launchers that are available on F-Droid and Google Play Store, although some are great. So I started developing this launcher which is small in size, fast, and full featured.

## Features
* Low Battery and CPU usage.
* Faster than fastest. :)
* Always free and open source with no ads.
* Material design.
* No icons and widgets.
* Colorful app names.
